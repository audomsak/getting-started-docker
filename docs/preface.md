# Docker Workshop

Containers are the future of highly-scalable software systems and have cost and runtime efficient supporting infrastructure. But learning it might look complex as it comes with many technicalities. This is where The Docker Workshop will help you.

Through this workshop, youâ€™ll quickly learn how to work with containers and Docker with the help of practical activities. While not going too much into depth, it covers the following topics:

- Running your first container
- Building containers
- Learning what containers are running and removing them
- Using volumes to persist data
- Using bind mounts to support development
- Using container networking to support multi-container applications
